# YouSnoozeYouWin

A webapp created in Django that takes a user's facial landmarks on their eyes and see's if they are sleepy or not. Based on this the web app will display directions and a visual path on a map to the nearest rest stop. The map and directions were created using the MapBox API. The nearest rest stop feature is not fully funcitonal but will be made functional in the future.
